# Mini TuneIn Player

This is a test task for **TuneIn**, showcasing a single-page radio streaming application built with React and TypeScript. The app allows users to browse and play various internet radio stations.

## Overview

The application allows users to:

- Browse a list of available radio stations
- Select and play any station
- View station details (image, name, description)
- Control playback: Play, Pause, Next, Previous
- Adjust volume using a dedicated slider
- Enjoy a smooth visual wave animation indicating when music is playing

> Instead of a standard progress bar (which doesn’t make sense for live radio), a subtle animated wave was implemented to reflect the playing state and improve visual feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** – fast frontend tooling for development
- **React** – component-based UI framework
- **TypeScript** – static type checking
- **CSS Modules** – scoped styling for components

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ekaterina-Kaschenko/mini-player.git
```
```bash

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.
